## Prodigy Infotech Internship Project

### Project Overview
Welcome to my internship project with Prodigy Infotech. In this project, I have developed five different applications covering a range of topics. Below is a brief description of each project along with explanations of the code.

### 1. Temperature Converter
The Temperature Converter is a simple C++ program that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It takes user input for the temperature in one unit and converts it to the other two units. The code utilizes basic arithmetic operations for temperature conversion.

**Explanation:** The program uses simple arithmetic formulas to convert temperatures between different units. For example, to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, it multiplies the Celsius temperature by 9/5 and then adds 32.

### 2. Guessing Game
The Guessing Game is a C++ program where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

**Explanation:** The program utilizes a random number generator to generate a secret number. It then prompts the user for guesses and compares them with the secret number using conditional statements to provide feedback.

### 3. Contact Management System
The Contact Management System is a C++ program that allows users to store and manage contact information. Users can add new contacts, view their contact list, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts. The program stores contacts in memory using a vector of contact objects.

**Explanation:** The program uses a class to represent contacts, with member functions to perform various operations like adding, viewing, editing, and deleting contacts. It uses vectors to store multiple contacts and provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

### 4. Sudoku Solver
The Sudoku Solver is a C++ program that solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking. It takes an input Sudoku grid and fills in the missing numbers to complete the puzzle. The program uses recursive backtracking to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers.

**Explanation:** The program uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. It iterates through each cell of the Sudoku grid, attempting to place numbers from 1 to 9. If a number can be placed without violating the Sudoku rules, it continues recursively until the puzzle is solved.

### 5. Web Scraping
The Web Scraping program is a Python script that extracts product information from an online e-commerce website and stores the data in a CSV file. It scrapes product names, prices, and ratings from the Best Sellers page of an e-commerce website using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries.

**Explanation:** The script sends a GET request to the specified URL, parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup, and extracts product information. It then saves the extracted data to a CSV file using the `csv` module. The script demonstrates basic web scraping techniques using Python.****
